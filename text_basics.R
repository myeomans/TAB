# Some basic text manipulation
######################################################################


# paste() joins text - default setting is to put a space in the middle

paste("x","y")

# paste0 changes the default to put nothing in the middle

paste0("x","y")

# paste handles vectors - if they are the same length, one item from the first 
# argument will be pasted to one from the second, and so on down the line

paste0(c("x","y","z"),
       c("a","b"))

# If the second argument is only one item long, 
# it is pasted to every item in the first argument

paste0(c("x","y"),
       c("a"))

# If they are unequal lengths you can get strange behavior - not recommended!
paste0(c("x","y","z"),
       c("a","b"))

# REs are a bit advanced for this class.. For now just memorize this one
# It basically means "the number of blocks of consecutive alphabetical characters"

# str_replace substitutes one character string for another


c("abcx","defxx","ghiy") %>%

# what happened? Again, this function uses "regular expressions"

# If you just want the literal characters, you need to "escape" them with \\
c("abc*","defx*","ghiy") %>%
  str_replace("\\*","y")

# We can delete character strings by replacing them with an empty string

c("abc","def","rabbit") %>%

# Notice it only replaces the first instance... to replace all, we usd a different function
